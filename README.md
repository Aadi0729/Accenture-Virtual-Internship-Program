# Accenture Virtual Internship Program

Accenture is a Global Fortune 500 company that provides consulting and processing services across many different domains. Software Engineers at Accenture may work on a vast range of programming languages and frameworks. Recently, a company has brought on Accenture to help with the development of its e-commerce website written in Java using the Spring Boot framework.

## TASK 1: Object Oriented Programming

The first task they need help with is searching for products.
One of the UX designers at Accenture has already implemented the new search capability in the UI. It’s my responsibility to implement the search capability in our backend Java app.
In this task, I was asked to write a class to perform search on an interactive website.

From this task, I refreshed my memory on Oops, Java and learned a new skill i.e., Spring.

## Task 2: Code Refactoring

A company has brought on Accenture to take over the development of their e-commerce website. I’ve recently implemented a new search API for them and now they’ve identified some code in the ReportController class that seems to be doing similar product searching. I was asked to refactor the SearchController logic into a new SearchService class that can be used in the SearchController as well as in the ReportController.
In this task, I have:
##### 1) Moved the logic from SearchController to SearchService
##### 2) Updated SearchController and ReportController both to use the SearchService
##### 3) Passed all unit tests

From this task, I learned how to refactor the code, Java and Spring.

## Task 3: Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where building and test runs can occur. In this task, I had used the most popular Continuous Integration tool, Jenkins. I had created a Jenkinsfile that will build and test the application on all branches of the repository.

In this task, I have:

##### 1) Created a GitHub account, Setup a Git CLI, forked and cloned a mock-company-webapp repository
##### 2) Defined a Jenkinsfile with stages setting it up to run on commit to any branch in the repository
##### 3) Made the Continuous Integration server to run build/test and succeeds
##### 4) Change made to code that breaks test. Continuous Integration server runs build/test and fails

From this task, I learned Continuous Integration, Jenkins & DevOps.

## Task 4: Agile Planning

In an Agile planning session, developers are given a set of large software features that they then must break up into smaller units of work, called stories, that can be completed within a one to three week period, called a sprint. A story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer and is made up of the following components:

##### Who the feature is for
##### What they need
##### Why they need it
##### What shows it’s done

In this task, I was asked to create a document that defines around 10 to 20 stories around the checkout feature.

From this task, I came to know about the Agile Methodology and Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
